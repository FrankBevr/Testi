# Working with PolkadotJS API

This Repo is a little Rundown of How to interact with an ink! Contract via PolkadotJs.  
I started simple, went thruh all relevant features of PolkadotJS.  
After I had the rundown, i made it a bit more nicer and added Vue.  
In the end i figured out how to make actually the Smart Contract Call and added it.  

See the **HelloWorld.vue** Component for How to interact with a deployed Smart contract.
